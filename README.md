In this assignment, you will work through Chapter 7 of the textbook (Visual Effects with CSS) to add
JavaScript to your Ottergram project.
Complete the following:
1. Work through Chapter 7. As you make changes to main.js, verify that you see error
messages reported by ESLint (for example, try leaving off a semicolon).
2. Confirm that clicking each thumbnail changes the detail image and title to match.
3. Add previous (<) and next (>) buttons on either side of the detail image. Use the buttons to
cycle back and forth through thumbnails and corresponding detail images and titles.
4. Push the contents of your project to a new GitHub repository. Do not push this assignment to
the same repository as Homework 0 and Homework 1.
